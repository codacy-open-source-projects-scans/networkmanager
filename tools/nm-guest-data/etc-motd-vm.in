*** nm-in-vm:

find NetworkManager bind mounted at {{BASEDIR_NM}}
run `nm-env-prepare.sh setup --idx 1` to setup test interfaces

Configure NetworkManager with `contrib/fedora/rpm/configure-for-system.sh`,
subsequent `meson install` will overwrite your system's NetworkManager,
and you can test it with `systemctl daemon-reload ; systemctl restart NetworkManager`.

Run NM-ci tests after creating eth1 with
`nm-env-prepare.sh --prefix eth -i 1 && sleep 1 && nmcli device connect eth1`.
